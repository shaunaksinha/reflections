What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The repo gets a .git folder which was not there beforehand. It becomes a 'git' repository as opposed to a normal repository. The.git folder stores details about all its files.
Without initializing a git repository, you cannot do any of the following: use git to track files in the repo,run commands and make use to it's features.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area that allows you to selectively add things from your working directory before maing a commit in the actual git repository. Without a staging area you would have to make all the changes in the working directory into a single commit.
