What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The repo gets a .git folder which was not there beforehand. It becomes a 'git' repository as opposed to a normal repository. The.git folder stores details about all its files.
Without initializing a git repository, you cannot do any of the following: use git to track files in the repo,run commands and make use to it's features.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area that allows you to selectively add things from your working directory before maing a commit in the actual git repository. Without a staging area you would have to make all the changes in the working directory into a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
All files can be added to the staging area as and when they are modified. And when the entire logical change is complete, all the files can be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be useful in storing records of commits related to a particular feature that was developed and thus would keep the history of the repo wrt that feature organized.
