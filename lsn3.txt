Diagrams help one to visualize the entire sequence of commits in a sequential manner. It also helps to understand which commits are unreachable.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging 2 branches together helps get all of the commits from both branches onto a single branch and also sorts them by their timestamps.
The diagram helps us to visualize how the commits are organised in sequential manner.
